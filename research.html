    <h3>Survey</h3>
      <p>
    A survey was used to verify the types of users that would be interested in using
technology to monitor a hydroponics system , this method was appropriate as it allows for
the collection of unbiased data from a wide range of potential users of the system. The
total number of surveys handed out and completed is ten.The survey questions were read
out by me to anyone who was willing to do the survey. In conducting the survey not many
people wanted to participate. The findings of the research show that all participants knew
what hydroponics is but when asked when asked what they knew about it none of them
knew anything besides growing plants with water and not soil. The findings show out of
the ten participants only two use hydroponics but the rest of the participants all said they
would be interested in using hydroponics. Both of the two participants that are currently
using hydroponics are not using technology to monitor their system. All the participants
said they would be interested in using technology to monitor a hydroponics system. The
overall finding is that using technology to monitor a hydroponics system is an idea that
would be successful when materialized.
This research method will allow for gathering a vast amount of data from many users
quickly. In carrying out this method surveys were handed out in one area so not many
people wanted to take the survey. Next time the survey should be handed out in different
areas in order to obtain more data.
</p>
<p>The survey questions used can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TlPoBGnBztdWEAFSeBf7DUluSUtXbWuQLtsWBAOaurg/edit">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Secondary Research</h3>
<p> To verify the validity of hydroponic systems for the cultivation of
plants secondary research was used. Online articles were very helpful because they helped
clarify what a hydroponics system is as well as the several advantages and disadvantages
associated with them. They provide detailed explanations on how they work as well as
why people will choose to use a system of such nature instead of traditional agricultural
techniques. Through the combination of knowledge gathered from those articles and
computer science we can now provide a new interface which users will enjoy.
For example, a hydroponic system to function properly, it needs to be heavily monitored.
 As a result only well trained professionals will be able to use it properly.
 However, with the introduction of the raspberry pie, sensors and a mobile app that process
 becomes significantly easier so even part time gardeners will be able to use it well. We
 have also gathered information on the raspberry pi on how it can be applied to this project.
</p>
<h3>Interviews</h3>
<p>Interviews were conducted to get a better understanding from a user perspective on how
managing a hydroponic system works. The user will give their opinions and experiences
on the topic, explaining different situations they faced and what can be done to solve it.
Using this method, the developer will have better insight of the user from conversing with
them to make a better product that can suit their target audience.
Interviews were scheduled with three individuals virtually via google meets. Some
interviews were recorded with permission of the interviewee and 5-7 questions were asked
while the interview was being conducted. The interviewee will give a brief introduction of
themselves and then give their opinions on hydroponics and what technologies can be
implemented.
From conducting the interviews, each interviewee had different explanations as to how
hydroponic systems work but it all led to the same conclusion that it is all dependent on
the quality of the water to provide nutrients for the plants to survive. Due to hydroponics
being a soilless based form of agriculture, a major finding from the interviews is that
quality control and management of the water is the most important factor in maintaining a
hydroponic system. From this, another finding discovered is that a key feature is a
centralized monitoring system where data such as ph (alkalinity) levels, ammonia levels,
temperatures, chlorate can be sent to the user. The user will also want a very simplistic
user interface where they can easily navigate and understand how their hydroponic system
is running as some may not know what the level numbers may be but instead information
like low, medium and high.
Conducting this research method is very viable considering the pandemic as well as it gave
informative insight as to what the user will expect for the app. Unfortunately, a major
disadvantage is scheduling meeting times as individuals are busy with their own personal
lives. This caused some interviews to be rescheduled and even cancelled due this factor.
What can be done better is to make a proper schedule day where both parties have to
commit to as well as have other interviews just in case.<p/>
